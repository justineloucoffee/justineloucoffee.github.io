<div class="about">
<p> 
  Hi, I'm Justine Lepage, also known as Loucoffee! I'm a French artist based in Cork, Ireland. I am self taught but I have always been passionate about drawing and all forms of creation. Over the years, I have been interested in theatre, improv, writing, and ceramics to name a few. I'm always looking for the next thing that will spark my interest!</p>

<p>My work focuses on whimsical and colourful illustrations, both watercolour and digital. It has been exhibited at St Peter's Cork and GOMA Gallery of Modern Art in Waterford. I like to draw gnomes, humans, and animals wearing party hats.</p>

<p>My main ongoing series of gnome paintings stemmed from a desire of freedom during the first covid lockdown, when I was stuck at home and lived magical adventure through these little adventurers. I particularly enjoy creating outfits for them, as fashion is another one of my interests.
