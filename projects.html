      <p>I was part of the editorial team for Motley, a UCC student magazine publication, for the academic year 2022-2023 and along my deputy editor Sinéad McKeown and some amazing collaborators, I put together photoshoots for all issues of the magazine, in a range of themes and styles, from mushroomcore to sports fan fashion. My missions included casting models, reaching out to photographers and brands, art direction, styling and more. I’m excited to try and get more styling experience moving forward!</p><br>

      <p class="subtitle-exhib">Wonderism Festival, 2023</p>
    <p>As part of my MA in Arts Management and Creative Producing in UCC, I was along the other members of the Canaille Collective at the helm of the Wonderism Festival, a one day arts festival in partnership with Cork Opera House. Using conventional and unconventional spaces within Cork Opera House, this was a one-day festival for everyone, with the theme of <i>Childlike Wonder</i> at its centre. Our programme comprised an exciting range of music, art and storytelling showcasing both emerging and established artists alongside students from Cork. I was part of the team working on the event <i>Behind the Curtain</i>, and the marketing and graphics team.
